You are now chatting with Allen Boyce

You:I need to limit apparel purchases to only five items per year.
Allen Boyce:Hello Rob, I hope you are doing well.
You:Hey Allen! Sorry, this one is kinda goofy
You:five items per year per user
Allen Boyce:There is no method of the system managing and/or limiting a site user to a certain of items
You:That's what I was afraid of...
Allen Boyce:When a site user reached their limit, someone could manually make the site user inactive. But nothing to
manage using the system
Allen Boyce:Someone would have to watch the orders on a daily basis I suppose
You:That's an idea, I was hoping to take the responsibility off of the management team. But, if that's the only way, I
guess we'll make it work.
You:Thank you for your time!
Allen Boyce:Ok Rob, is there anything else I can help you with before we close this chat?
You:Nope, thank you!

So, I'm trying to figure out how to set up the AG Marketing User Rules but I'm stumped... Allen Boyce said, "There is no
method of the system managing and/or limiting a site user to a certain number of items"
