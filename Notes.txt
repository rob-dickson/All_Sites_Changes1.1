Observation of issue... When the sales department has a change 
that needs to be implemented to a site products design, should 
it go through design first and then go to Kylie? Or is Kylie 
the gatekeeper that does her own design work when she wants 
and asks for help when she needs to?

This muzzle brake was designed to offer hunters and shooters who use a traditional tapered barrel or mountain rifle an option for a side ported brake over the less effective radial brakes often seen or supplied with these firearms. Machined from titanium and offered either polished or in color offerings to match your barrel, these brakes offer recoil reduction of over 60% and improve the look with very little weight added.
